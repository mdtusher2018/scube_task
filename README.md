# suceb_task

This task consisting of a **Login page** and a **Dashboard**, implemented with **Clean Architecture**, **feature-based structure**, and **Riverpod** for state management.

> ⚠️ Note: The task was UI-focused and only a Figma design was provided. Therefore, full backend/API integration was **not required**. The project demonstrates architectural decisions, code organization, and best practices rather than complete business logic for all features.

## 🔐 Login Feature (Fully Implemented)

The **Login feature** is the only feature fully implemented end-to-end using Clean Architecture.

### Implementation Details

* **State Management:** Riverpod
* **Layers Used:**

  * Data
  * Domain
  * Presentation

### Dummy Authentication Logic

* If email is **`tusher@gmail.com`** → Login **Success**
* Any other email → API call fails

```dart
// Example logic (simplified)
if (email == 'tusher@gmail.com') {
  return LoginSuccess(dommy_data);
} else {
  return Failure();
}
```

* A dummy API endpoint (`http://dommyapi.com`) is intentionally called for failure cases.
* This demonstrates **repository responsibility** and error handling.

✅ This section showcases:

* Proper separation of concerns
* Repository pattern
* Use cases
* Riverpod notifiers

---

## 📊 Dashboard Feature (UI-Oriented)

The **Dashboard** was implemented primarily from a **UI perspective**, as per the task requirement.

### Pages Implemented

1. **Dashboard Empty View**
2. **Main Dashboard View**
3. **Energy Data Details View**

### Key Notes

* Folder structure follows Clean Architecture principles. Since no API was required for the dashboard, this separation is mainly used for clean code organization and widget reusability.
* **No API calls implemented** for dashboard
* **No Riverpod notifiers implemented** for dashboard
* Only **domain models** were created where necessary to keep code clean

---

## 🚧 Unimplemented Sections

To maintain clarity for reviewers:

* An `unimplemented/` file is added in folders which is skiped
* Contains placeholder files indicating intentionally skipped logic
* Helps reviewers **easily identify** what was not part of the task scope

```dart
// unimplemented file
// This section is intentionally left unimplemented
// as the task was focused on UI only
```

---

## 🧩 Widgets Strategy

* Reusable widgets are placed under:

  * `shared/widgets` → app-wide reusable widgets
  * `dashboard/presentation/widgets` → dashboard-only widgets

This ensures:

* Clean UI code
* Better readability
* Scoped widget usage

---

## 🎨 UI Implementation

* UI strictly follows the provided **Figma design**
* Consistent theming using `AppColors`
* Layout logic kept minimal in pages by extracting widgets

---

## 🎯 Why This Approach?

* Demonstrates **real-world scalable architecture**
* Shows understanding of Clean Architecture even for UI-heavy tasks
* Makes it easy to extend the project with real APIs later
* Keeps reviewer experience simple and transparent

---

## 🔧 Possible Improvements

The following improvements were intentionally left out due to the limited scope and timeline of the interview task, but could be added to enhance scalability and maintainability:

### Centralized asset management
Currently, images and icons are accessed directly from the assets directory. Introducing a dedicated class (e.g. `AppImages`)—similar to `ApiEndpoints` or `AppColors`—would centralize asset paths, making them easier to manage, update, and maintain across the application.

### Asset folder organization
At the moment, all images and icons are placed in a single assets directory. Organizing assets by type or feature (e.g. `assets/images/`, `assets/icons/`, `assets/illustrations/`) would improve project structure, readability, and long-term maintainability.

### SVG support for icons
Some icons are currently used as PNG assets (`x1`, `x2`), which is sufficient for mobile screens. However, for web or large displays, this may lead to pixelation. Using SVG assets would provide sharper visuals and better scalability across different screen sizes.

## ✅ Summary

* ✔ Login: Fully implemented with Clean Architecture + Riverpod
* ✔ Dashboard: UI-complete, architecture-ready
* ✔ Feature-based scalable structure
* ✔ Clear separation of implemented vs non-implemented logic

This project focuses on **code quality, structure, and architectural clarity**, aligned with the expectations of an interview assignment.
